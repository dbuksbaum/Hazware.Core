Hazware.Core
============

Everyone seems to have their own collection of utility code they use over and over again. I am no exception. However, I am trying to refactor my single library of a few hundred classes, many of which implement functionality now available in .NET 4, or other more well developed libraries. My goal is to implement the minimum amount of code I rely on, that cannot be easily replaced by another available library. Why? I have a general philosophy for code that I call the Race to Zero. It is about reducing the amount of code I need to support to achieve my goal. With less code, comes less support needs, and that allows me to focus on the key functionality.
